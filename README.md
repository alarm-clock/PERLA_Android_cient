# JMB_BMS

Jmb_bms is a battle management system extension for the Locus Map application developed by Assam software. I am creating it as a bachelor's thesis at Brno University of Technology Faculty of Information Technologies.
Jmb_bms aims to build on Locus Map using its API, which gives location information, points of interest, and more features to enhance the Vannila application. The main features will be 

- [ ] Location sharing between units
- [ ] Points of interest sharing
- [ ] Chat
- [ ] Orders
- [ ] Live map drawing

Even though it may not compete with commercial battle management systems like Personal Eye System by Milsystemica, it will feature most of its functionality, and it will be free to download for the public.
